# To search a file for a pattern:
grep <pattern> <file>


# To perform a case-insensitive search (with line numbers):
grep -in <pattern> <file>


# To recursively grep for string <pattern> in <dir>, R follows symlinks while r doesn't:
grep -R <pattern> <dir>


# Read search patterns from a file (one per line):
grep -f <pattern-file> <file>


# Find lines NOT containing pattern:
grep -v <pattern> <file>


# To grep with regular expressions: Match lines starting with 00
grep "^00" <file>                                               
grep -E "[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}" <file> # Find IP add


# To find all files that match <pattern> in <dir>
grep -rnw <dir> -e <pattern>


# To exclude grep from your grepped output of ps:
# (Add [] to the first letter. Ex: sshd -> [s]shd)
ps aux | grep '[h]ttpd'


# Colour in red {bash} and keep all other lines
ps aux | grep -E --color 'bash|$'


# To include or exclude a dir use
grep --exclude="dir" "pattern" .


# Exclude folders, to include folder use --include
grep --exclude-dir="staticfolder" --exclude-dir="venv" 'debugger' -r .


# To match the whole pattern use -w
grep -w "pattern" .
